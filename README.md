# file-path-getter-copier
a short python script with a GUI that copies to the clipboard the path of the selected file
- the ui was built with tkinter
- the exe file was compiled with pyinstaller from the py one and is for the people who have dificulties with cmd and python
- how to use: for the exe file just double click and select the file, the complete file's path is going to be copied to the clipboard
for the py file, (you must have python installed) open a cmd where the file is and type python file_path.py ; the popup should open and now you just have to select the file and the complete file's path is going to be copied to the clipboard.
